# Silicon map
## About
### Context
Silicon Map is a Java desktop application developed as part of a group project (two people) during the second year of university studies.

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a monitoring application for machines in a data center. Some details are intentionally simplified, as this project is not intended for production use and we are not data center management experts. Our main objective is to demonstrate our ability to develop a professional application within a limited timeframe (approximately one month).

### Warning
This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for production use.
## Dependencies
- Javafx (user interface)
- mysql-connector (connection with mysql db)
